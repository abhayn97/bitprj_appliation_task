## About Me

Hello! I'm Abhay, a Computer Science graduate student at the University of Southern California. I'm passionate about web development.
I am also a Certified Yoga Instructor (RYT 500) and have been professionally teaching for over a year.
I've been playing the 'Tabla' (a type of hand drums from India) since the age of 5, and love listening to music.
I love reading books. The Inheritance Cycle written by Christopher Paolini and Steve Jobs' biography written by Walter Isaacson are a couple of my favorite books.
